# CrystalMetricDex
Metric Dex Entries for use with PokeCrystal Decompilation

This contains all the files you need to implement the metric system into Pokemon Crystal (probably works with gold and silver too)

Copy and paste the three directorys into your pokecrystal folder and thats it.

Alternatively you can just use the dex_entries, the pokedex gfx and edit engine/pokedex/pokedex.asm yourself as per my tutorial.

Now with a Python script which will go through and change all of the dex entries to metric values, simply put the script into your `data/pokemon/dex_entries` folder and run it.
